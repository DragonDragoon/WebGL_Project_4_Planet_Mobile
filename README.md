This project is an implementation of a solar system using WebGL and orientating coordinate systems to get them to rotate.
All shapes, made of vertices, and coordinate systems are rendered in real-time and can be controlled with the various controls.

Note: This project uses JavaScript that is not supported in Internet Explorer 8 and below. It will run fine on Internet Explorer 9 and above, as well as any later Chrome and Firefox versions.

This project can be run and viewed directly:  <b><a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/DragonDragoon/Portfolio/blob/master/JavaScript/Planet%20Mobile%20%28ITCS-3120_Computer_Graphics%29/Planet%20Mobile.html">Here</a></b>.
